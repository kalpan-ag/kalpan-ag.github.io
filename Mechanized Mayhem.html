								<b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Mechanized Mayhem is an intense and fast-paced first-person shooter game where you must take on hordes of evil robots to save humanity.<br>
								<b>Summary of Core Gameplay:</b> The core gameplay of Mechanized Mayhem revolves around the player character's rage mode. The player must eliminate as many enemies as possible to fill their rage meter, which will grant them access to their rage mode. Once activated, the player becomes faster and more powerful, with access to lasers to mow down waves of enemies. The gameplay also emphasizes strategic positioning and movement, as the enemies are melee-focused and will quickly kill the player if they get too close.

								<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/MechanisedMayhem/MechanizedMayhem.png"  alt="" /></span>
									Mechanized Mayhem is a first-person shooter game where players take on the role of an anti-AI fighter who must infiltrate and eliminate a robot factory. 
									The game is set in a series of levels that increase in difficulty as the player progresses. The core gameplay revolves around players using a range of weapons to defeat waves of enemy robots while avoiding being killed by them. 
									The player character has a set of standard guns that can be used to deal damage to the robots from a distance. However, the robots are designed to get close to the player, which increases the risk of death.
									To combat this, players have access to a "rage mode" ability that can be triggered when they have defeated enough enemies. 
									This ability temporarily makes the player character faster, more durable, and capable of firing lasers, making it easier to defeat waves of enemies quickly.<br>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/MechanisedMayhem/Level.png" alt="" /></span>
										The game's levels are designed to provide a challenge to players, with an increasing number of enemies and obstacles to navigate as they progress through the game. 
										The levels are designed with multiple paths that the player can take, allowing for a degree of exploration and strategy as players choose the best route to take.
										The game also features a variety of environments, including dark corridors, large open rooms, and outdoor areas. The level design incorporates cover, obstacles, 
										and varying heights to create a dynamic and engaging experience. To create a sense of immersion and realism, the game features detailed textures, lighting, and sound effects. 
										The use of particle effects, such as sparks and explosions, adds to the intensity of combat and helps to communicate when the player character is in "rage mode."
