								<h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
	
								<p><blockquote>With a Master's degree in Game Science and Design from Northeastern University, I am actively pursuing roles in the evolving sphere of Game, XR, and Immersive Development. My journey now encompasses a unique blend of high-level Unreal Engine and C++ development, proven experience in VR/AI simulation, and practical expertise in IT Operations Management (including managing core systems like PMS and network infrastructure).
									<Br>I bring a unique combination of technical proficiency, robust system management skills, and design-thinking to the table, positioning me as a resourceful and results-driven problem-solver. My enthusiasm for immersive experiences and exploring emerging technologies—from real-time physics and AI to large-scale operational reliability—propels my interest in pioneering the future of digital interaction. I thrive in collaborative environments that echo my zeal for innovation and creative technical challenge.</blockquote>
