								<b>Roles:</b> 3D Developer, Level Design, Environment Design | Team Size: 2<br>
								<b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Nothing Gold Can Stay is a first-person horror game that traps the player in an infinitely looping room. As they progress through the game, they discover evidence of the explorers who came before them and what happened to them when they were trapped. Eventually, the player character will be presented with an in-game choice to pick up the gold, destroy the temple, or to keep going and persist to eventually find their way out.<br>
								<b>Summary of Core Gameplay:</b> The core gameplay of Nothing Gold Can Stay is based on exploration and discovery. Players navigate through an infinitely looping level and collect items and clues that reveal the backstory and the fate of the previous explorers. There are also choices that the player can make that will affect the ending of the game.

								<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/NothingGoldCanStay/Main Level Entry.png"  alt="" /><br><br><img src="images/NothingGoldCanStay/SCreenshot2.png" alt="" />

								</span>
									The game starts with the player character trapped in a large room with a large altar in the middle. 
									The player will progress through the level, encountering evidence of the explorers who came before them and discovering the mechanics of the game. 
									The level is designed to loop seamlessly, with the player always coming back to the beginning of the room whenever they reach the end. 
									The objects and props in the game, such as the doorway, ax, and gold, serve to advance the plot and challenge the player's preconceptions.
								<p>
									The anticipated player flow through the environment is that players will navigate through the first loop relatively quickly. When they go through the first loop and re-enter the level from the beginning, they will feel confused as to what happened and whether they did something wrong during their "first playthrough." At that point, they will pay more attention to the level and identify new objects within the environment. Lastly, the game challenges the player's preconceptions by giving them a weapon during later loops, leading to the "bad" ending.
