							<b>Roles:</b> 3D Developer, Gameplay Programmer | Team Size: 10<br>
							<b>Elevator Pitch:</b> 
							Rosary is a gothic 2.5D roguelike narrative dungeon crawler where a girl named Rosy seeks vengeance upon a religious order, “The Hands of the Allfather”, for burning her family at the stake due to supposed witchcraft. 
							Possessed by Surtan, a powerful demonic entity, Rosy is compelled by the whispers in her mind to fight her way through the Temple of the Allfather to reach the Divine Gate, which Surtan has told her lies within the Inner Sanctum.
							<br>
							<b>Summary of Core Gameplay:</b> 
							Rosary is a 2.5D dungeon crawler that combines rogue-like elements with narrative storytelling. Players control Rosy as she navigates through a procedurally generated Temple of the Allfather, 
							fighting off hordes of zealots and holy knights along the way. The game features fast-paced combat, challenging boss fights, and a unique dual personality system that allows players to switch between Rosy's human and demonic forms. 
							Each form has its own strengths and weaknesses, making it necessary to strategically switch between the two in order to overcome obstacles and progress through the game.

									<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Rosary/Insane_Rosy.png"  alt="" /><br><img src="images/Rosary/Rosy_VN_Sprites01.png" alt="" /></span>
										Rosary's gameplay revolves around fast-paced combat and strategic exploration. The game features randomly generated levels that change with each playthrough, making each run a unique experience. 
										The enemies in the game use a detection cone system to track the player and will either follow or attack them depending on their proximity. 
										The player must avoid contact with enemies as even a single touch results in instant death.
										<p>
											The game's level design is intricately crafted to create an immersive gothic atmosphere. The Temporal Garden is overgrown with vegetation and ruins, creating an eerie ambiance. 
											The Halls of Verity are ornately carved and protected by holy knights and zealots. The Inner Sanctum is the final chamber, guarded by clerics and priests, leading up to the Divine Gate. 
											Each area is designed to reflect the religious order's beliefs and practices, creating a coherent and immersive world.

								<p><b>Project Goal:</b>
									The primary goal of Rosary was to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience that blended roguelike gameplay with a compelling narrative. 
									The team aimed to develop a game that was challenging and rewarding to play, with an intricate level design and unique dual personality system.
									<br><h5>My Roles and Responsibilities:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>As a developer on the Rosary team, my responsibilities included developing player movement, enemy AI, behaviour and movement, randomised procedural level generation, sprite animations, and other technical aspects of the game.</li>
										</ul>
									<h5>Tools and Technologies:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Game Engine: Godot</li>
										<li>Programming Languages: GDScript</li>
										<li>PC Hardware: Windows PC</li>
										<li>Design Tools: Adobe Creative Cloud, Davinci</li>
										<li>Project Management: Trello, Miro, GitHub</li>
									</ul>
									<h5>Challenges and Solutions:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>One of the biggest challenges in developing Rosary was creating a procedurally generated level system that was both challenging and engaging for players. 
											The team addressed this challenge by creating a series of custom algorithms that generated random layouts for each level, ensuring that each playthrough was unique and engaging.
										</li>
										<li>Another challenge was developing the game's dual personality system. The team had to ensure that each form had its own unique strengths and weaknesses, 
											while also creating a seamless switching mechanic that didn't disrupt the flow of gameplay. This was achieved through careful balancing and iteration.
										</li>
