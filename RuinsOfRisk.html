									<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/RuinsOfRisk/Sketch.png"  alt="" /><br><img src="images/RuinsOfRisk/Sketch2.png" alt="" /></span>

										Ruins of Risk features a third-person camera perspective that allows players to fully immerse themselves in the game world. The game takes place in the ruins of an ancient temple, with each level featuring unique challenges and obstacles to overcome. The level design is focused on creating a sense of danger and urgency, with traps and hazards that will test your reflexes and timing. For example, wind zones will blow players away, while falling in water results in instant death and a respawn at the starting point.
									<p>
										The ludonarrative resonance design problem is tackled in Ruins of Risk by removing the player's ability to reload from a recent checkpoint, creating a sense of danger and fear of losing progress. As the player progresses through the game, the challenges become more difficult, increasing the fear of dying and the desire to succeed.

								<p><b>Project Goal:</b>
									The goal of the project was to create a challenging parkour game that combined fast-paced action with immersive environments and intense moments of danger.
									 The focus was on creating a sense of ludonarrative resonance, where players feel connected to their character and experience the danger and urgency of the game world.
									<br><h5>My Roles and Responsibilities:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>Created the initial concept for the game and designed the core gameplay mechanics.</li>
											<li>Implemented the gameplay mechanics and controls.</li>
											<li>Added sound effects and music for the game.</li>
										</ul>
									<h5>Tools and Technologies:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Game Engine: Unity</li>
										<li>Programming Languages: C#</li>
										<li>PC Hardware: Windows PC</li>
										<li>Design Tools: Adobe Creative Cloud, Davinci</li>
										<li>Project Management: Trello, Miro, GitHub</li>
									</ul>
									<h5>Challenges and Solutions:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>One of the biggest challenges of the project was creating a level design that was both challenging and fair. 
											To solve this, we used a playtesting approach where we continually tweaked the level design based on player feedback to ensure a balance between difficulty and playability.
										</li>
										<li>Another challenge was implementing the ludonarrative resonance design approach, which required a careful balance between creating a sense of danger and frustration for players. 
											This was solved by testing and iterating on the checkpoint system to create a balance between difficulty and player progression.
										</li>

									Ruins of Risk was a challenging and rewarding project that allowed me to explore the intersection between gameplay and narrative design. Through the ludonarrative resonance approach, we were able to create a sense of immersion and connection between the player and the game world, resulting in a memorable and engaging gameplay experience.
